1. Can you briefly explain why Erlang was developed and why it has recently seen a resurgence?
2. List five perceived benefits of Elixir over Erlang?
3. Show us how we could get documentation in **iex** for **Enum.at**?
4. Could you explain the difference between binding in FP and assignment in
   other languages and could you provide examples in Elixir? Can a variable be
   rebound in Elixir and Erlang?
5. What command can you use to exit the Erlang runtime system?
6. Create a **Math** module with a **square** function, load the file through iex
   and pass in an integer.
7. What do the characters **?** and **i** indicate at the end of functions
   names? Do they affect compiled behaviour in any way?
8. Can you explain what the pipeline operator does and why it is useful?
9. Can a module span more than one file? Can you demonstrate it?
10. How would you idiomatically format your code on the command line using **mix**
11. What is the default value operator for a function in Elixir?
12. Could you use a private function in a module and demonstrate that it cannot be called in another module?
13. Could you create two modules with a function in one and use an **import** statement in the other module?
14. Could you alias any kernel function and demonstrate it in code?
15. What are the two attributes to document modules and functions?
16. What are the two **falsey** values in Elixir?
17. Create a tuple with your name and age, and extract you name using Kernel.elem
18. What are tuples mostly used for?
20. Here is a list of integer is **list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**, how would Elixir traverse to the last element in this list?
21. Can you demonstrate that the integer **6** is not in the above list
22. Use a function to "replace" **5** in the above list with **6**.
23. Using **insert_at** from the List module insert an element at the end of
    the list. Why would this be expensive on a large list?
24. Concatenate two lists of your own choice
25. Extract the head of a list with a Kernel function and patten matching.
26. Create a map upto five key/pairs which starts with the key **1** and the value **one**
27. Extract the third element from the list using any manner
28. How would you throw an **exception** if a key is not in a map?
29. Show two ways of extracting the value of a key in a match which is an atom
30. Define a string with an interpolation with the expression 2 + 2
31. What's the difference between binary strings and character lists?
32. What does a function class function mean and could you provide an example?
33. Can you write a longhand function and its shorthand counterpart using the capture operator
